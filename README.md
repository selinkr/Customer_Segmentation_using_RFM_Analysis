# Customer_Segmentation_using_RFM_Analysis

FLO, an online shoe store, wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. 
For this purpose, behaviors of customers will be defined and groups will be formed according to clusters in these behaviors.
RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) Analysis is used for customer segmentation. Real FLO data is used in the project.

Recency is the time since the customer's last purchase, Frequency is the total number of purchases by customer, and Monetary is the total financial value of all purchases.
