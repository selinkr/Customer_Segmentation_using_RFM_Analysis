# Customer_Segmentation_using_RFM_Analysis

FLO, an online shoe store, wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. 
For this purpose, behaviors of customers will be defined and groups will be formed according to clusters in these behaviors.
RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) Analysis is used for customer segmentation. Real FLO data is used in the project.

Recencyâ€”The time since the customer's last purchase
Frequency-The total number of purchases by customer
Monetary-Total financial value of all purchases
